/*
Time Complexity: let N be the number of words in document and M the number of unique words in it (M â‰¤ N). Iterating over all words, cleaning them and inserting them into a map takes O(N). The sorting step takes O(M) since notice that in the second loop, every word gets visited only once. The total time complexity is therefore O(N + M), which is O(N).

Space Complexity: wordMap takes O(M) space and the array of strings array, counterList, takes another O(M). So, in total, the space complexity is O(M).
